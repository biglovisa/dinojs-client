    title: "Stegosaurus",
    text: "Fossils of this genus date to the Late Jurassic period, where they are found in Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian aged strata, between 155 and 150 million years ago, in the western United States of America and Portugal."

    title: "Velociraptor",
    text: "However, whereas most theropods had feet with three digits contacting the ground, dromaeosaurids like Velociraptor walked on only their third and fourth digits. The second digit, for which Velociraptor is most famous, was highly modified and held retracted off the ground. It bore a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, which could grow to over 6.5 cm long around its outer edge, was most likely a predatory device used to tear into or restrain struggling prey."

    title: "Triceratops",
    text: "The first named specimen now attributed to Triceratops is a pair of brow horns attached to a skull roof, found near Denver, Colorado in the spring of 1887."

  {
    title: "Spinosaurus",
    text: "Spinosaurus is known to have eaten fish, and most scientists believe that it hunted both terrestrial and aquatic prey; evidence suggests that it lived both on land and in water as a modern crocodilian does."
  },
  {
    title: "Brachiosaurus",
    text: "Brachiosaurus was a quadrupedal animal with a small skull, a long neck, a large trunk with a high-ellipsoid cross section, a long, muscular tail and slender, columnar limbs. Large air sacs connected to the lung system were present in the neck and trunk, invading the vertebrae and ribs, greatly reducing the overall density."

  {
    title: "Masosaurus",
    text: "The first remains known to science were a fragmentary skull from a chalk quarry in the St Pietersberg, a hill near Maastricht, the Netherlands, found in 1764 and collected by lieutenant Jean Baptiste Drouin in 1766. It considered it to be a species of \"big breathing fish\" (Pisces cetacei, in other words: a whale)."
  },
  {
    title: "Allosaurus",
    text: "Allosaurus was a large bipedal predator. Its skull was large and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated teeth. It averaged 8.5 m (28 ft) in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over 12 m (39 ft). Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail."

  {
    title: "Brontosaurus",
    text: "Brontosaurus had long, thin necks and small heads, adapted for a herbivorous lifestyle; a bulky, heavy torso; and long, whip-like tails. The various species lived during the Late Jurassic epoch in the Morrison Formation of North America, going extinct by the end of the Jurassic."

  {
    title: "Dilophosaurus",
    text: "Dilophosaurus was featured in the novel Jurassic Park and its movie adaptation, wherein it was given the fictional abilities to spit venom and expand a cowl on its neck, as well as being smaller than the real animal. It was designated as the state dinosaur of Connecticut in 2017."
  },
  {
    title: "Pteranodon",
    text: "They lived during the late Cretaceous geological period of North America in present-day Kansas, Alabama, Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota. More fossil specimens of Pteranodon have been found than any other pterosaur, with about 1,200 specimens known to science, many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons."
